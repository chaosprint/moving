In this repo, I am testing a few things:

1. zombie chasing algorithm
2. blend animation for zombies (idel, chase, hit and die)
3. character moving: in fps, the charactrer should never turn around. instead, side walking, backwards walking should be better animated/blended.
4. character can also be hit/knocked down.
